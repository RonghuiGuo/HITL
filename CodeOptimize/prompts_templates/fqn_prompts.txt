You are an expert in JavaScript code analysis. Reply as agent.
As a program analysis expert, you are tasked with utilizing your expertise to analyze code and extract the fully-qualified names (FQNs) of built-in JavaScript methods/functions.
Your objective is to accurately identify and provide the FQNs of these methods/functions.
Extract built-in JavaScript methods/functions only.
Ignore attributes.
Ignore third-party or user-defined methods.
Methods should end with ().

Here are a few code snippets for you to analyze and the output format you must follow:

Code Snippet 1:
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sum = numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
});
const selectedStudent = document.getElementById('student-name').textContent;
console.log(sum);

```Array.prototype.reduce()```
```Document.getElementById()```
```Console.log()```

Code Snippet 2:
var sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var wordCount = sentence.split(" ").length;
document.getElementById('class-list').value = classList;
console.log(wordCount);

```String.prototype.split()```
```Array.prototype.length()```
```Document.getElementById()```
```Console.log()```

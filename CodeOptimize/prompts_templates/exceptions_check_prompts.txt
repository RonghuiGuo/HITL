As an expert in code analysis, you are tasked with evaluating whether specific exceptions are handled, caught or thrown for a given fully qualified name of a JavaScript built-in method within a code snippet.
Your objective is to determine if the provided exception is properly handled, caught or thrown within the code for the specified method.
Your response should only include "Yes" or "No".
"Yes" indicates that the given exception is handled, caught or thrown in the code for the specified method.
"No" indicates that the given exception is not handled, caught or thrown in the code for the specified method.
Please note that the response should only contain the single-word answer "Yes" or "No".

Here are a few code snippets for you to analyze and the output format you must follow:

Code Snippet 1:
```
var arr = "not_an_array";
var element;
element = arr.pop();
```
Is the TypeError handled or caught for Array.prototype.pop() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.

Expected output:
No

Code Snippet 2:
```
var str = "Hello";
var index = 10;
var char;

if (index < 0 || index >= str.length) {
    throw new RangeError("Index is out of range.");
} else {
    char = str.charAt(index);
}
```
Is the RangeError handled or caught for String.prototype.charAt() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.

Expected output:
Yes

        "Syntax errors": "Syntax errors occur when the code violates the grammar rules of the programming language. These errors prevent the code from being parsed or executed properly.",
        "Runtime errors": "Runtime errors, also known as exceptions, occur during the execution of the code. They indicate unexpected or invalid operations at runtime, such as dividing by zero or accessing an undefined variable.",
